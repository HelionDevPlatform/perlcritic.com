<P>Test::Perl::Critic::Policy - A framework for testing your custom Policies

</P><H1><A NAME="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS

</A></H1>

<PRE>    use Test::Perl::Critic::Policy qw&lt; all_policies_ok &gt;;

    # Assuming .run files are inside 't' directory...
    all_policies_ok()

    # Or if your .run files are in a different directory...
    all_policies_ok( '-test-directory' =&gt; 'run' );

    # And if you just want to run tests for some polices...
    all_policies_ok( -policies =&gt; ['Some::Policy', 'Another::Policy'] );

    # If you want your test program to accept short Policy names as
    # command-line parameters...
    #
    # You can then test a single policy by running
    # &quot;perl -Ilib t/policy-test.t My::Policy&quot;.
    my %args = @ARGV ? ( -policies =&gt; [ @ARGV ] ) : ();
    all_policies_ok(%args);

<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>This module provides a framework for function-testing your custom
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/Policy.html">Perl::Critic::Policy</A> modules.  Policy testing usually
involves feeding it a string of Perl code and checking its behavior.  In the
old days, those strings of Perl code were mixed directly in the test script.
That sucked.

</P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> This module is alpha code -- interfaces and implementation are
subject to major changes.  This module is an integral part of building and
testing <A HREF="Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A> itself, but you should not write any code
against this module until it has stabilized.

</A></DT>
<DD>
Loads all the <I>*.run</I> files beneath the <CODE>-test-directory</CODE> and runs the
tests.  If <CODE>-test-directory</CODE> is not specified, it defaults to <I>t/</I>.
<CODE>-policies</CODE> is an optional reference to an array of shortened Policy names.
If <CODE>-policies</CODE> specified, only the tests for Policies that match one of the
<CODE>m/$POLICY_NAME/imx</CODE> will be run.

<P>Testing a policy follows a very simple pattern:

</P>
<PRE>    * Policy name
        * Subtest name
        * Optional parameters
        * Number of failures expected
        * Optional exception expected
        * Optional filename for code</PRE>

<P>Each of the subtests for a policy is collected in a single <I>.run</I>
file, with test properties as comments in front of each code block
that describes how we expect Perl::Critic to react to the code.  For
example, say you have a policy called Variables::ProhibitVowels:

</P>
<PRE>    (In file t/Variables/ProhibitVowels.run)

    ## name Basics
    ## failures 1
    ## cut

    my $vrbl_nm = 'foo';    # Good, vowel-free name
    my $wango = 12;         # Bad, pronouncable name


    ## name Sometimes Y
    ## failures 1
    ## cut

    my $yllw = 0;       # &quot;y&quot; not a vowel here
    my $rhythm = 12;    # But here it is</PRE>

<P>These are called &quot;subtests&quot;, and two are shown above.  The beauty of
incorporating multiple subtests in a file is that the <I>.run</I> is
itself a (mostly) valid Perl file, and not hidden in a HEREDOC, so
your editor's color-coding still works, and it is much easier to work
with the code and the POD.

</P>
<P>If you need to pass any configuration parameters for your subtest, do
so like this:

</P>
<PRE>    ## parms { allow_y =&gt; '0' }</PRE>

<P>Note that all the values in this hash must be strings because that's
what Perl::Critic will hand you from a <I>.perlcriticrc</I>.

</P>
<P>If it's a TODO subtest (probably because of some weird corner of PPI
that we exercised that Adam is getting around to fixing, right?), then
make a <CODE>##TODO</CODE> entry.

</P>
<PRE>    ## TODO Should pass when PPI 1.xxx comes out</PRE>

<P>If the code is expected to trigger an exception in the policy,
indicate that like so:

</P>
<PRE>    ## error 1</PRE>

<P>If you want to test the error message, mark it with <CODE>/.../</CODE> to
indicate a <CODE>like()</CODE> test:

</P>
<PRE>    ## error /Can't load Foo::Bar/</PRE>

<P>If the policy you are testing cares about the filename of the code,
you can indicate that <CODE>fcritique</CODE> should be used like so (see
<CODE>fcritique</CODE> for more details):

</P>
<PRE>    ## filename lib/Foo/Bar.pm</PRE>

<P>The value of <CODE>parms</CODE> will get <CODE>eval</CODE>ed and passed to <CODE>pcritique()</CODE>,
so be careful.

</P>
<P>In general, a subtest document runs from the <CODE>## cut</CODE> that starts it to
either the next <CODE>## name</CODE> or the end of the file. In very rare circumstances
you may need to end the test document earlier. A second <CODE>## cut</CODE> will do
this. The only known need for this is in
<I>t/Miscellanea/RequireRcsKeywords.run</I>, where it is used to prevent the RCS
keywords in the file footer from producing false positives or negatives in the
last test.

</P>
<P>Note that nowhere within the <I>.run</I> file itself do you specify the
policy that you're testing.  That's implicit within the filename.


</P><H1><A NAME="BUGS%20AND%20CAVEATS%20AND%20TODO%20ITEMS">BUGS AND CAVEATS AND TODO ITEMS

</A></H1>

<P>Add policy_ok() method for running subtests in just a single TODO file.

</P>
<P>Can users mark this entire test as TODO or SKIP, using the normal mechanisms?

</P>
<P>Allow us to specify the nature of the failures, and which one.  If there are
15 lines of code, and six of them fail, how do we know they're the right six?

</P>
<P>Consolidate code from <A HREF="Perl/Critic/TestUtils.html">Perl::Critic::TestUtils</A> and possibly deprecate some
functions there.

</P>
<P>Write unit tests for this module.

</P>
<P>Test that we have a t/*/*.run for each lib/*/*.pm
