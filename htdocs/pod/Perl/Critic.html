<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>Perl::Critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying coding
standards to Perl source code.  Essentially, it is a static source code
analysis engine.  Perl::Critic is distributed with a number of
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/Policy.html">Perl::Critic::Policy</A> modules that attempt to enforce various coding
guidelines.  Most Policy modules are based on Damian Conway's book <B>Perl Best
Practices</B>.  However, Perl::Critic is <B>not</B> limited to PBP and will even
support Policies that contradict Conway.  You can enable, disable, and
customize those Polices through the Perl::Critic interface.  You can also
create new Policy modules that suit your own tastes.

</P>
<P>For a command-line interface to Perl::Critic, see the documentation for
<A HREF="perlcritic.html">perlcritic</A>.  If you want to integrate Perl::Critic with your build process,
<A HREF="Test/Perl/Critic.html">Test::Perl::Critic</A> provides an interface that is suitable for test scripts.
For the ultimate convenience (at the expense of some flexibility) see the
<A HREF="criticism.html">criticism</A> pragma.

</P>
<P>Win32 and ActivePerl users can find PPM distributions of Perl::Critic at
<A HREF="http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/">http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/</A>.

</P>
<P>If you'd like to try <A HREF="Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A> without installing anything, there is a
web-service available at <A HREF="http://perlcritic.com">http://perlcritic.com</A>.  The web-service does not
yet support all the configuration features that are available in the native
Perl::Critic API, but it should give you a good idea of what it does.  You can
also invoke the perlcritic web-service from the command-line by doing an
HTTP-post, such as one of these:

</P>
<PRE>   $&gt; POST http://perlcritic.com/perl/critic.pl &lt; MyModule.pm
   $&gt; lwp-request -m POST http://perlcritic.com/perl/critic.pl &lt; MyModule.pm
   $&gt; wget -q -O - --post-file=MyModule.pm http://perlcritic.com/perl/critic.pl</PRE>

<P>Please note that the perlcritic web-service is still alpha code.  The URL and
interface to the service are subject to change.

<P>Returns a reference to a new Perl::Critic object.  Most arguments are just
passed directly into <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Config.html">Perl::Critic::Config</A>, but I have described them here
as well.  The default value for all arguments can be defined in your
<I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.  See the <A HREF="#CONFIGURATION">&quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;</A> section for more
information about that.  All arguments are optional key-value pairs as
follows:

</P>
<P><B>-profile</B> is a path to a configuration file. If <CODE>$FILE</CODE> is not defined,
Perl::Critic::Config attempts to find a <I>.perlcriticrc</I> configuration file in
the current directory, and then in your home directory.  Alternatively, you
can set the <CODE>PERLCRITIC</CODE> environment variable to point to a file in another
location.  If a configuration file can't be found, or if <CODE>$FILE</CODE> is an empty
string, then all Policies will be loaded with their default configuration.
See <A HREF="#CONFIGURATION">&quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;</A> for more information.

</P>
<P><B>-severity</B> is the minimum severity level.  Only Policy modules that have a
severity greater than <CODE>$N</CODE> will be applied.  Severity values are integers
ranging from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe).  The default is 5.  For a
given <CODE>-profile</CODE>, decreasing the <CODE>-severity</CODE> will usually reveal more Policy
violations.  You can set the default value for this option in your
<I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.  Users can redefine the severity level for any Policy
in their <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.  See <A HREF="#CONFIGURATION">&quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;</A> for more information.

</P>
<P>If it is difficult for you to remember whether severity &quot;5&quot; is the most or
least restrictive level, then you can use one of these named values:

</P>
<PRE>    SEVERITY NAME   ...is equivalent to...   SEVERITY NUMBER
    --------------------------------------------------------
    -severity =&gt; 'gentle'                     -severity =&gt; 5
    -severity =&gt; 'stern'                      -severity =&gt; 4
    -severity =&gt; 'harsh'                      -severity =&gt; 3
    -severity =&gt; 'cruel'                      -severity =&gt; 2
    -severity =&gt; 'brutal'                     -severity =&gt; 1</PRE>

<P><B>-theme</B> is special expression that determines which Policies to apply based
on their respective themes.  For example, the following would load only
Policies that have a 'bugs' AND 'pbp' theme:

</P>
<PRE>  my $critic = Perl::Critic-&gt;new( -theme =&gt; 'bugs &amp;&amp; pbp' );</PRE>

<P>Unless the <CODE>-severity</CODE> option is explicitly given, setting <CODE>-theme</CODE> silently
causes the <CODE>-severity</CODE> to be set to 1.  You can set the default value for
this option in your <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.  See the <A HREF="#POLICY%20THEMES">&quot;POLICY THEMES&quot;</A> section
for more information about themes.


</P>
<P><B>-include</B> is a reference to a list of string <CODE>@PATTERNS</CODE>.  Policy modules
that match at least one <CODE>m/$PATTERN/imx</CODE> will always be loaded, irrespective
of all other settings.  For example:

</P>
<PRE>  my $critic = Perl::Critic-&gt;new(-include =&gt; ['layout'] -severity =&gt; 4);</PRE>

<P>This would cause Perl::Critic to apply all the <CODE>CodeLayout::*</CODE> Policy modules
even though they have a severity level that is less than 4.  You can set the
default value for this option in your <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.  You can also use
<CODE>-include</CODE> in conjunction with the <CODE>-exclude</CODE> option.  Note that <CODE>-exclude</CODE>
takes precedence over <CODE>-include</CODE> when a Policy matches both patterns.

</P>
<P><B>-exclude</B> is a reference to a list of string <CODE>@PATTERNS</CODE>.  Policy modules
that match at least one <CODE>m/$PATTERN/imx</CODE> will not be loaded, irrespective of
all other settings.  For example:

</P>
<PRE>  my $critic = Perl::Critic-&gt;new(-exclude =&gt; ['strict'] -severity =&gt; 1);</PRE>

<P>This would cause Perl::Critic to not apply the <CODE>RequireUseStrict</CODE> and
<CODE>ProhibitNoStrict</CODE> Policy modules even though they have a severity level that
is greater than 1.  You can set the default value for this option in your
<I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.  You can also use <CODE>-exclude</CODE> in conjunction with the
<CODE>-include</CODE> option.  Note that <CODE>-exclude</CODE> takes precedence over <CODE>-include</CODE>
when a Policy matches both patterns.

</P>
<P><B>-singlepolicy</B> is a string <CODE>PATTERN</CODE>.  Only one policy that matches
<CODE>m/$PATTERN/imx</CODE> will be used.  Policies that do not match will be excluded.
This option has precedence over the <CODE>-severity</CODE>, <CODE>-theme</CODE>, <CODE>-include</CODE>,
<CODE>-exclude</CODE>, and <CODE>-only</CODE> options.  You can set the default value for this
option in your <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.

</P>
<P><B>-top</B> is the maximum number of Violations to return when ranked by their
severity levels.  This must be a positive integer.  Violations are still
returned in the order that they occur within the file.  Unless the
<CODE>-severity</CODE> option is explicitly given, setting <CODE>-top</CODE> silently causes the
<CODE>-severity</CODE> to be set to 1.  You can set the default value for this option in
your <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.

</P>
<P><B>-only</B> is a boolean value.  If set to a true value, Perl::Critic will only
choose from Policies that are mentioned in the user's profile.  If set to a
false value (which is the default), then Perl::Critic chooses from all the
Policies that it finds at your site.  You can set the default value for this
option in your <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.

</P>
<P><B>-force</B> is a boolean value that controls whether Perl::Critic observes the
magical <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> pseudo-pragmas in your code.  If set to a true
value, Perl::Critic will analyze all code.  If set to a false value (which is
the default) Perl::Critic will ignore code that is tagged with these comments.
See <A HREF="#BENDING%20THE%20RULES">&quot;BENDING THE RULES&quot;</A> for more information.  You can set the default
value for this option in your <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.

</P>
<P><B>-verbose</B> can be a positive integer (from 1 to 11), or a literal format
specification.  See <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Violations.html">Perl::Critic::Violations</A> for an explanation of format
specifications.  You can set the default value for this option in your
<I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.

</P>
<P><B>-config</B> is a reference to a <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Config.html">Perl::Critic::Config</A> object.  If you have
created your own Config object for some reason, you can pass it in here
instead of having Perl::Critic create one for you.  Using the <CODE>-config</CODE>
option causes all the other options to be silently ignored.

Runs the <CODE>$source_code</CODE> through the Perl::Critic engine using all the
Policies that have been loaded into this engine.  If <CODE>$source_code</CODE> is a
scalar reference, then it is treated as a string of actual Perl code.  If
<CODE>$source_code</CODE> is a reference to an instance of <A HREF="PPI/Document.html">PPI::Document</A>, then that
instance is used directly.  Otherwise, it is treated as a path to a local file
containing Perl code.  This method returns a list of
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/Violation.html">Perl::Critic::Violation</A> objects for each violation of the loaded Policies.
The list is sorted in the order that the Violations appear in the code.  If
there are no violations, this method returns an empty list.

This argument is required.

</P>
<P><B>-params</B> is an optional reference to a hash of Policy parameters.  The

<P>For those folks who prefer to have a functional interface, The <CODE>critique</CODE>
method can be exported on request and called as a static function.  If the
first argument is a hashref, its contents are used to construct a new
Perl::Critic object internally.  The keys of that hash should be the same as
those supported by the <CODE>Perl::Critic::new</CODE> method.  Here are some examples:

</P>
<PRE>  use Perl::Critic qw(critique);

  # Use default parameters...
  @violations = critique( $some_file );

  # Use custom parameters...
  @violations = critique( {-severity =&gt; 2}, $some_file );

  # As a one-liner
  %&gt; perl -MPerl::Critic=critique -e 'print critique(shift)' some_file.pm</PRE>

<P>None of the other object-methods are currently supported as static
functions.  Sorry.

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION

</A></H1>

<P>Most of the settings for Perl::Critic and each of the Policy modules can be
controlled by a configuration file.  The default configuration file is called
<I>.perlcriticrc</I>.  Perl::Critic will look for this file in the current
directory first, and then in your home directory.  Alternatively, you can set
the <CODE>PERLCRITIC</CODE> environment variable to explicitly point to a different file
in another location.  If none of these files exist, and the <CODE>-profile</CODE> option
is not given to the constructor, then all the modules that are found in the
Perl::Critic::Policy namespace will be loaded with their default
configuration.

</P>
<P>The format of the configuration file is a series of INI-style blocks that
contain key-value pairs separated by '='. Comments should start with '#' and
can be placed on a separate line or after the name-value pairs if you desire.

</P>
<P>Default settings for Perl::Critic itself can be set <B>before the first named
block.</B> For example, putting any or all of these at the top of your
configuration file will set the default value for the corresponding
constructor argument.

</P>
<PRE>    severity  = 3                                     #Integer or named level
    only      = 1                                     #Zero or One
    force     = 0                                     #Zero or One
    verbose   = 4                                     #Integer or format spec
    top       = 50                                    #A positive integer
    theme     = (pbp || security) &amp;&amp; bugs             #A theme expression
    include   = NamingConventions ClassHierarchies    #Space-delimited list
    exclude   = Variables  Modules::RequirePackage    #Space-delimited list</PRE>

<P>The remainder of the configuration file is a series of blocks like this:

</P>
<PRE>    [Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName]
    severity = 1
    set_themes = foo bar
    add_themes = baz
    arg1 = value1
    arg2 = value2</PRE>

<P><CODE>Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName</CODE> is the full name of a module
that implements the policy.  The Policy modules distributed with Perl::Critic
have been grouped into categories according to the table of contents in Damian
Conway's book <B>Perl Best Practices</B>. For brevity, you can omit the
<CODE>'Perl::Critic::Policy'</CODE> part of the module name.

</P>
<P><CODE>severity</CODE> is the level of importance you wish to assign to the Policy.  All
Policy modules are defined with a default severity value ranging from 1 (least
severe) to 5 (most severe).  However, you may disagree with the default
severity and choose to give it a higher or lower severity, based on your own
coding philosophy.  You can set the <CODE>severity</CODE> to an integer from 1 to 5, or
use one of the equivalent names:

</P>
<PRE>    SEVERITY NAME ...is equivalent to... SEVERITY NUMBER
    ----------------------------------------------------
    gentle                                             5
    stern                                              4
    harsh                                              3
    cruel                                              2
    brutal                                             1</PRE>

<P><CODE>set_themes</CODE> sets the theme for the Policy and overrides its default theme.
The argument is a string of one or more whitespace-delimited alphanumeric
words.  Themes are case-insensitive.  See <A HREF="#POLICY%20THEMES">&quot;POLICY THEMES&quot;</A> for more
information.

</P>
<P><CODE>add_themes</CODE> appends to the default themes for this Policy.  The argument is
a string of one or more whitespace-delimited words.  Themes are
case-insensitive.  See <A HREF="#POLICY%20THEMES">&quot;POLICY THEMES&quot;</A> for more information.

</P>
<P>The remaining key-value pairs are configuration parameters that will be passed
into the constructor for that Policy.  The constructors for most Policy
objects do not support arguments, and those that do should have reasonable
defaults.  See the documentation on the appropriate Policy module for more
details.

</P>
<P>Instead of redefining the severity for a given Policy, you can completely
disable a Policy by prepending a '-' to the name of the module in your
configuration file.  In this manner, the Policy will never be loaded,
regardless of the <CODE>-severity</CODE> given to the Perl::Critic constructor.

</P>
<P>A simple configuration might look like this:

</P>
<PRE>    #--------------------------------------------------------------
    # I think these are really important, so always load them

    [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict]
    severity = 5

    [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseWarnings]
    severity = 5

    #--------------------------------------------------------------
    # I think these are less important, so only load when asked

    [Variables::ProhibitPackageVars]
    severity = 2

    [ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
    allow = if unless  # My custom configuration
    severity = cruel   # Same as &quot;severity = 2&quot;

    #--------------------------------------------------------------
    # Give these policies a custom theme.  I can activate just
    # these policies by saying `perlcritic -theme larry`

    [Modules::RequireFilenameMatchesPackage]
    add_themes = larry

    [TestingAndDebugging::RequireTestLables]
    add_themes = larry curly moe

    #--------------------------------------------------------------
    # I do not agree with these at all, so never load them

    [-NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseVars]
    [-NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseSubs]

    #--------------------------------------------------------------
    # For all other Policies, I accept the default severity,
    # so no additional configuration is required for them.</PRE>

<P>For additional configuration examples, see the <I>perlcriticrc</I> file
that is included in this <I>examples</I> directory of this distribution.

</P>
<P>Damian Conway's own Perl::Critic configuration is also included in this
distribution as <I>examples/perlcriticrc-conway</I>.

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="THE%20POLICIES">THE POLICIES

</A></H1>

<P>A large number of Policy modules are distributed with Perl::Critic.  They are
described briefly in the companion document <A HREF="Perl/Critic/PolicySummary.html">Perl::Critic::PolicySummary</A> and
in more detail in the individual modules themselves.  Say <CODE>&quot;perlcritic -doc
PATTERN&quot;</CODE> to see the perldoc for all Policy modules that match the regex
<CODE>m/PATTERN/imx</CODE>


</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="POLICY%20THEMES">POLICY THEMES

</A></H1>

<P>Each Policy is defined with one or more &quot;themes&quot;.  Themes can be used to
create arbitrary groups of Policies.  They are intended to provide an
alternative mechanism for selecting your preferred set of Policies.  For
example, you may wish disable a certain subset of Policies when analyzing test
scripts.  Conversely, you may wish to enable only a specific subset of
Policies when analyzing modules.

</P>
<P>The Policies that ship with Perl::Critic are have been broken into the
following themes.  This is just our attempt to provide some basic logical
groupings.  You are free to invent new themes that suit your needs.

</P>
<PRE>    THEME             DESCRIPTION
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    core              All policies that ship with Perl::Critic
    pbp               Policies that come directly from &quot;Perl Best Practices&quot;
    bugs              Policies that that prevent or reveal bugs
    maintenance       Policies that affect the long-term health of the code
    cosmetic          Policies that only have a superficial effect
    complexity        Policies that specificaly relate to code complexity
    security          Policies that relate to security issues
    tests             Policies that are specific to test scripts
</PRE>

<P>Any Policy may fit into multiple themes.  Say <CODE>&quot;perlcritic -list&quot;</CODE> to get a
listing of all available Policies and the themes that are associated with each
one.  You can also change the theme for any Policy in your <I>.perlcriticrc</I>
file.  See the <A HREF="#CONFIGURATION">&quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;</A> section for more information about that.

</P>
<P>Using the <CODE>-theme</CODE> option, you can create an arbitrarily complex rule that
determines which Policies will be loaded.  Precedence is the same as regular
Perl code, and you can use parens to enforce precedence as well.  Supported
operators are:

</P>
<PRE>   Operator    Altertative    Example
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   &amp;&amp;          and            'pbp &amp;&amp; core'
   ||          or             'pbp || (bugs &amp;&amp; security)'
   !           not            'pbp &amp;&amp; ! (portability || complexity)'</PRE>

<P>Theme names are case-insensitive.  If the <CODE>-theme</CODE> is set to an empty string,
then it evaluates as true all Policies.

<P>Perl::Critic takes a hard-line approach to your code: either you comply or you
don't.  In the real world, it is not always practical (nor even possible) to
fully comply with coding standards.  In such cases, it is wise to show that
you are knowingly violating the standards and that you have a Damn Good Reason
(DGR) for doing so.

</P>
<P>To help with those situations, you can direct Perl::Critic to ignore certain
lines or blocks of code by using pseudo-pragmas:

</P>
<PRE>    require 'LegacyLibaray1.pl';  ## no critic
    require 'LegacyLibrary2.pl';  ## no critic

    for my $element (@list) {

        ## no critic

        $foo = &quot;&quot;;               #Violates 'ProhibitEmptyQuotes'
        $barf = bar() if $foo;   #Violates 'ProhibitPostfixControls'
        #Some more evil code...

        ## use critic

        #Some good code...
        do_something($_);
    }</PRE>

<P>The <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> comments direct Perl::Critic to ignore the remaining
lines of code until the end of the current block, or until a <CODE>&quot;## use
critic&quot;</CODE> comment is found (whichever comes first).  If the <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE>
comment is on the same line as a code statement, then only that line of code
is overlooked.  To direct perlcritic to ignore the <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> comments,
use the <CODE>-force</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>A bare <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> comment disables all the active Policies.  If you
wish to disable only specific Policies, add a list of Policy names as
arguments, just as you would for the <CODE>&quot;no strict&quot;</CODE> or <CODE>&quot;no warnings&quot;</CODE>
pragmas.  For example, this would disable the <CODE>ProhibitEmptyQuotes</CODE> and
<CODE>ProhibitPostfixControls</CODE> policies until the end of the block or until the
next <CODE>&quot;## use critic&quot;</CODE> comment (whichever comes first):

</P>
<PRE>  ## no critic (EmptyQuotes, PostfixControls)

  # Now exempt from ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyQuotes
  $foo = &quot;&quot;;

  # Now exempt ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls
  $barf = bar() if $foo;

  # Still subjected to ValuesAndExpression::RequireNumberSeparators
  $long_int = 10000000000;</PRE>

<P>Since the Policy names are matched against the <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> arguments as
regular expressions, you can abbreviate the Policy names or disable an entire
family of Policies in one shot like this:

</P>
<PRE>  ## no critic (NamingConventions)

  # Now exempt from NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseVars
  my $camelHumpVar = 'foo';

  # Now exempt from NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseSubs
  sub camelHumpSub {}</PRE>

<P>The argument list must be enclosed in parens and must contain one or more
comma-separated barewords (e.g. don't use quotes).  The <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE>
pragmas can be nested, and Policies named by an inner pragma will be disabled
along with those already disabled an outer pragma.

</P>
<P>Some Policies like <CODE>Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity</CODE> apply to an entire
block of code.  In those cases, <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> must appear on the line
where the violation is reported.  For example:

</P>
<PRE>  sub complicated_function {  ## no critic (ProhibitExcessComplexity)
      # Your code here...
  }</PRE>

<P>Policies such as <CODE>Documentation::RequirePodSections</CODE> apply to the entire
document, in which case violations are reported at line 1.  But if the file
requires a shebang line, it is impossible to put <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> on the
first line of the file.  This is a known limitation and it will be addressed
in a future release.  As a workaround, you can disable the affected policies
at the command-line or in your <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.  But beware that this
will affect the analysis of <B>all</B> files.

</P>
<P>Use this feature wisely.  <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> should be used in the smallest
possible scope, or only on individual lines of code. And you should always be
as specific as possible about which policies you want to disable (i.e. never
use a bare <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE>).  If Perl::Critic complains about your code, try
and find a compliant solution before resorting to this feature.

<H1><A NAME="IMPORTANT%20CHANGES">IMPORTANT CHANGES

</A></H1>

<P>Perl-Critic is evolving rapidly, so some of the interfaces have changed in
ways that are not backward-compatible.  If you have been using an older
version of Perl-Critic and/or you have been developing custom Policy modules,
please read this section carefully.

</P><H2><A NAME="VERSION%200.23">VERSION 0.23

</A></H2>

<P>In version 0.23, the syntax for theme rules changed.  The mathematical
operators ( &quot;*&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot; ) are no longer supported.  You must use logical
operators instead ( &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, &quot;||&quot; ).  However the meanings of these
operators is effectively the same.  See <A HREF="#POLICY%20THEMES">&quot;POLICY THEMES&quot;</A> for more details.

</P><H2><A NAME="VERSION%200.21">VERSION 0.21

</A></H2>

<P>In version 0.21, we introduced the concept of policy &quot;themes&quot;.  All you
existing custom Policies should still be compatible.  But to take advantage of
the theme feature, you should add a <CODE>default_themes</CODE> method to your custom
Policy modules.  See <A HREF="Perl/Critic/DEVELOPER.html">Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER</A> for an up-to-date guide on
creating Policy modules.

</P>
<P>The internals of Perl::Critic were also refactored significantly.  The public
API is largely unchanged, but if you've been accessing bits inside
Perl::Critic, then you may be in for a surprise.

</P><H2><A NAME="VERSION%200.16">VERSION 0.16

</A></H2>

<P>Starting in version 0.16, you can add a list Policy names as arguments to the
<CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> pseudo-pragma.  This feature allows you to disable specific
policies.  So if you have been in the habit of adding additional words after
<CODE>&quot;no critic&quot;</CODE>, then those words might cause unexpected results.  If you want
to append other stuff to the <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> comment, then terminate the
pseudo-pragma with a semi-colon, and then start another comment.  For example:

</P>
<PRE>    #This may not work as expected.
    $email = 'foo@bar.com';  ## no critic for literal '@'

    #This will work.
    $email = 'foo@bar.com';  ## no critic; #for literal '@'

    #This is even better.
    $email = 'foo@bar.com'; ## no critic (RequireInterpolation);</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="VERSION%200.14">VERSION 0.14

</A></H2>

<P>Starting in version 0.14, the interface to <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Violation.html">Perl::Critic::Violation</A> changed.
This will also break any custom Policy modules that you might have written for
earlier modules. See <A HREF="Perl/Critic/DEVELOPER.html">Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER</A> for an up-to-date guide on
creating Policy modules.

</P>
<P>The notion of &quot;priority&quot; was also replaced with &quot;severity&quot; in version 0.14.
Consequently, the default behavior of Perl::Critic is to only load the most
&quot;severe&quot; Policy modules, rather than loading all of them.  This decision was
based on user-feedback suggesting that Perl-Critic should be less critical for
new users, and should steer them toward gradually increasing the strictness as
they progressively adopt better coding practices.

</P><H2><A NAME="VERSION%200.11">VERSION 0.11

</A></H2>

<P>Starting in version 0.11, the internal mechanics of Perl-Critic were rewritten
so that only one traversal of the PPI document tree is required.
Unfortunately, this will break any custom Policy modules that you might have
written for earlier versions.  Converting your policies to work with the new
version is pretty easy and actually results in cleaner code.  See
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/DEVELOPER.html">Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER</A> for an up-to-date guide on creating Policy modules.

<H1><A NAME="THE%20Perl%3a%3aCritic%20PHILOSOPHY">THE <A HREF="Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A> PHILOSOPHY

</A></H1>

<PRE>  Coding standards are deeply personal and highly subjective.  The
  goal of Perl::Critic is to help you write code that conforms with a
  set of best practices.  Our primary goal is not to dictate what
  those practices are, but rather, to implement the practices
  discovered by others.  Ultimately, you make the rules --
  Perl::Critic is merely a tool for encouraging consistency.  If there
  is a policy that you think is important or that we have overlooked,
  we would be very grateful for contributions, or you can simply load
  your own private set of policies into Perl::Critic.</PRE>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="EXTENDING%20THE%20CRITIC">EXTENDING THE CRITIC

</A></H1>

<P>The modular design of Perl::Critic is intended to facilitate the addition of
new Policies.  You'll need to have some understanding of <A HREF="PPI.html">PPI</A>, but most
Policy modules are pretty straightforward and only require about 20 lines of
code.  Please see the <A HREF="Perl/Critic/DEVELOPER.html">Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER</A> file included in this
distribution for a step-by-step demonstration of how to create new Policy
modules.

</P>
<P>If you develop any new Policy modules, feel free to send them to <CODE>&lt;thaljef@cpan.org&gt;</CODE> and I'll be happy to put them into the Perl::Critic
distribution.  Or if you would like to work on the Perl::Critic project
directly, check out our repository at <A HREF="http://perlcritic.tigris.org">http://perlcritic.tigris.org</A>.  To
subscribe to our mailing list, send a message to <CODE>&lt;dev-subscribe@perlcritic.tigris.org&gt;</CODE>.

</P>
<P>The Perl::Critic team is also available for hire.  If your organization has
its own coding standards, we can create custom Policies to enforce your local
guidelines.  Or if your code base is prone to a particular defect pattern, we
can design Policies that will help you catch those costly defects <B>before</B>
they go into production.  To discuss your needs with the Perl::Critic team,
just contact <CODE>&lt;thaljef@cpan.org&gt;</CODE>.
