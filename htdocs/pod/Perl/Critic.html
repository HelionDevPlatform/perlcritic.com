<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>Perl::Critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying
coding standards to Perl source code.  Essentially, it is a static
source code analysis engine.  Perl::Critic is distributed with a
number of <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Policy.html">Perl::Critic::Policy</A> modules that attempt to enforce
various coding guidelines.  Most Policy modules are based on Damian
Conway's book <B>Perl Best Practices</B>.  However, Perl::Critic is <B>not</B>
limited to PBP and will even support Policies that contradict Conway.
You can enable, disable, and customize those Polices through the
Perl::Critic interface.  You can also create new Policy modules that
suit your own tastes.

</P>
<P>For a convenient command-line interface to Perl::Critic, see the
documentation for <A HREF="perlcritic.html">perlcritic</A>.  If you want to integrate
Perl::Critic with your build process, <A HREF="Test/Perl/Critic.html">Test::Perl::Critic</A> provides
an interface that is suitable for test scripts.  For the ultimate
convenience (at the expense of some flexibility) see the <A HREF="criticism.html">criticism</A>
pragma.

</P>
<P>Win32 and ActivePerl users can find PPM distributions of Perl::Critic
at <A HREF="http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/">http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/</A>.

</P>
<P>If you'd like to try <A HREF="Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A> before you install it, there is a
web-service available at <A HREF="http://perlcritic.com">http://perlcritic.com</A>.  The web-service
does not yet support all the configuration features that are available
in the native Perl::Critic API, but it should give you a good idea
of what it does.

<DD>

<P>Returns a reference to a new Perl::Critic object.  Most arguments are
just passed directly into <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Config.html">Perl::Critic::Config</A>, but I have described
them here as well.  All arguments are optional key-value pairs as
follows:

</P>
<P><B>-profile</B> is a path to a configuration file. If <CODE>$FILE</CODE> is not
defined, Perl::Critic::Config attempts to find a <I>.perlcriticrc</I>
configuration file in the current directory, and then in your home
directory.  Alternatively, you can set the <CODE>PERLCRITIC</CODE> environment
variable to point to a file in another location.  If a configuration
file can't be found, or if <CODE>$FILE</CODE> is an empty string, then all
Policies will be loaded with their default configuration.  See
<A HREF="#CONFIGURATION">&quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;</A> for more information.

</P>
<P><B>-severity</B> is the minimum severity level.  Only Policy modules that
have a severity greater than <CODE>$N</CODE> will be loaded.  Severity values
are integers ranging from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe).  The
default is 5.  For a given <CODE>-profile</CODE>, decreasing the <CODE>-severity</CODE>
will usually result in more Policy violations.  Users can redefine the
severity level for any Policy in their <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file.  See
<A HREF="#CONFIGURATION">&quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;</A> for more information.

</P>
<P><B>-include</B> is a reference to a list of string <CODE>@PATTERNS</CODE>.  Policy
modules that match at least one <CODE>m/$PATTERN/imx</CODE> will always be
loaded, irrespective of the severity settings.  For example:

</P>
<PRE>  my $critic = Perl::Critic-&gt;new(-include =&gt; ['layout'] -severity =&gt; 4);</PRE>

<P>This would cause Perl::Critic to load all the <CODE>CodeLayout::*</CODE> Policy
modules even though they have a severity level that is less than 4.
You can use <CODE>-include</CODE> in conjunction with the <CODE>-exclude</CODE> option.
Note that <CODE>-exclude</CODE> takes precedence over <CODE>-include</CODE> when a Policy
matches both patterns.

</P>
<P><B>-exclude</B> is a reference to a list of string <CODE>@PATTERNS</CODE>.  Policy
modules that match at least one <CODE>m/$PATTERN/imx</CODE> will not be loaded,
irrespective of the severity settings.  For example:

</P>
<PRE>  my $critic = Perl::Critic-&gt;new(-exclude =&gt; ['strict'] -severity =&gt; 1);</PRE>

<P>This would cause Perl::Critic to not load the <CODE>RequireUseStrict</CODE> and
<CODE>ProhibitNoStrict</CODE> Policy modules even though they have a severity
level that is greater than 1.  You can use <CODE>-exclude</CODE> in conjunction
with the <CODE>-include</CODE> option.  Note that <CODE>-exclude</CODE> takes precedence
over <CODE>-include</CODE> when a Policy matches both patterns.

</P>
<P><B>-top</B> is the maximum number of Violations to return when ranked by
their severity levels.  Violations are still returned in the order
that they occur within the file.  This must be a positive integer

</P>
<P><B>-force</B> controls whether Perl::Critic observes the magical <CODE>&quot;## no
critic&quot;</CODE> pseudo-pragmas in your code.  If set to a true value,
Perl::Critic will analyze all code.  If set to a false value (which is
the default) Perl::Critic will ignore code that is tagged with these
comments.  See <A HREF="#BENDING%20THE%20RULES">&quot;BENDING THE RULES&quot;</A> for more information.

</P>
<P><B>-config</B> is a reference to a <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Config.html">Perl::Critic::Config</A> object.  If you
have created your own Config object for some reason, you can pass it
in here instead of having Perl::Critic create one for you.  Using the
<CODE>-config</CODE> option causes all the other options to be silently ignored.

<DD>
Runs the <CODE>$source_code</CODE> through the Perl::Critic engine using all the
Policies that have been loaded into this engine.  If <CODE>$source_code</CODE>
is a scalar reference, then it is treated as string of actual Perl
code.  If <CODE>$source_code</CODE> is a reference to an instance of
<A HREF="PPI/Document.html">PPI::Document</A>, then that instance is used directly.  Otherwise, it
is treated as a path to a local file containing Perl code.  This
method Returns a list of <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Violation.html">Perl::Critic::Violation</A> objects for each
violation of the loaded Policies.  The list is sorted in the order
that the Violations appear in the code.  If there are no violations,
this method returns an empty list.

<P>Creates a Policy object and loads it into this Critic.  If the object

</P>
<P><B>-policy</B> is the name of a <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Policy.html">Perl::Critic::Policy</A> subclass
module.  The <CODE>'Perl::Critic::Policy'</CODE> portion of the name can be
omitted for brevity.  This argument is required.

parameters.  Note that this is <B>not</B> the same thing as a
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/Config.html">Perl::Critic::Config</A> object. The contents of this hash reference
will be passed into to the constructor of the Policy module.  See the

arguments it supports.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="FUNCTIONAL%20INTERFACE">FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE

</A></H1>

<P>For those folks who prefer to have a functional interface, The
<CODE>critique</CODE> method can be exported on request and called as a static
function.  If the first argument is a hashref, its contents are used
to construct a new Perl::Critic object internally.  The keys of that
hash should be the same as those supported by the <CODE>Perl::Critic::new</CODE>
method.  Here are some examples:

</P>
<PRE>  use Perl::Critic qw(critique);

  # Use default parameters...
  @violations = critique( $some_file );

  # Use custom parameters...
  @violations = critique( {-severity =&gt; 2}, $some_file );

  # As a one-liner
  %&gt; perl -MPerl::Critic=critique -e 'print critique(shift)' some_file.pm</PRE>

<P>None of the other object-methods are currently supported as static
functions.  Sorry.

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION

</A></H1>

<P>The default configuration file is called <I>.perlcriticrc</I>.
Perl::Critic will look for this file in the current directory first,
and then in your home directory.  Alternatively, you can set the
<CODE>PERLCRITIC</CODE> environment variable to explicitly point to a different
file in another location.  If none of these files exist, and the
<CODE>-profile</CODE> option is not given to the constructor, then all the
modules that are found in the Perl::Critic::Policy namespace will be
loaded with their default configuration.

</P>
<P>The format of the configuration file is a series of INI-style sections
that contain key-value pairs separated by '='. Comments should start
with '#' and can be placed on a separate line or after the name-value
pairs if you desire.  The general recipe is a series of blocks like
this:

</P>
<PRE>  [Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName]
  severity = 1
  arg1 = value1
  arg2 = value2</PRE>

<P><CODE>Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName</CODE> is the full name of a
module that implements the policy.  The Policy modules distributed
with Perl::Critic have been grouped into categories according to the
table of contents in Damian Conway's book <B>Perl Best Practices</B>. For
brevity, you can omit the <CODE>'Perl::Critic::Policy'</CODE> part of the
module name.

</P>
<P><CODE>severity</CODE> is the level of importance you wish to assign to the
Policy.  All Policy modules are defined with a default severity value
ranging from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe).  However, you may
disagree with the default severity and choose to give it a higher or
lower severity, based on your own coding philosophy.

</P>
<P>The remaining key-value pairs are configuration parameters that will
be passed into the constructor for that Policy.  The constructors for
most Policy objects do not support arguments, and those that do should
have reasonable defaults.  See the documentation on the appropriate
Policy module for more details.

</P>
<P>Instead of redefining the severity for a given Policy, you can
completely disable a Policy by prepending a '-' to the name of the
module in your configuration file.  In this manner, the Policy will
never be loaded, regardless of the <CODE>-severity</CODE> given to the
Perl::Critic constructor.

</P>
<P>A simple configuration might look like this:

</P>
<PRE>  #--------------------------------------------------------------
  # I think these are really important, so always load them

  [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict]
  severity = 5

  [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseWarnings]
  severity = 5

  #--------------------------------------------------------------
  # I think these are less important, so only load when asked

  [Variables::ProhibitPackageVars]
  severity = 2

  [ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
  allow = if unless  #My custom configuration
  severity = 2

  #--------------------------------------------------------------
  # I do not agree with these at all, so never load them

  [-NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseVars]
  [-NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseSubs]

  #--------------------------------------------------------------
  # For all other Policies, I accept the default severity,
  # so no additional configuration is required for them.
</PRE>

<P>A few sample configuration files are included in this distribution
under the <I>t/samples</I> directory. The <I>perlcriticrc.none</I> file
demonstrates how to disable Policy modules.  The
<I>perlcriticrc.levels</I> file demonstrates how to redefine the severity
level for any given Policy module.  The <I>perlcriticrc.pbp</I> file
configures Perl::Critic to load only Policies described in Damian
Conway's book &quot;Perl Best Practice.&quot;

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="THE%20POLICIES">THE POLICIES

</A></H1>

<P>A large number of Policy modules are distributed with Perl::Critic.
They are described briefly in the companion document
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/PolicySummary.html">Perl::Critic::PolicySummary</A> and in more detail in the individual
modules themselves.

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="BENDING%20THE%20RULES">BENDING THE RULES

</A></H1>

<P>Perl::Critic takes a hard-line approach to your code: either you
comply or you don't.  In the real world, it is not always practical
(nor even possible) to fully comply with coding standards.  In such
cases, it is wise to show that you are knowingly violating the
standards and that you have a Damn Good Reason (DGR) for doing so.

</P>
<P>To help with those situations, you can direct Perl::Critic to ignore
certain lines or blocks of code by using pseudo-pragmas:

</P>
<PRE>    require 'LegacyLibaray1.pl';  ## no critic
    require 'LegacyLibrary2.pl';  ## no critic

    for my $element (@list) {

        ## no critic

        $foo = &quot;&quot;;               #Violates 'ProhibitEmptyQuotes'
        $barf = bar() if $foo;   #Violates 'ProhibitPostfixControls'
        #Some more evil code...

        ## use critic

        #Some good code...
        do_something($_);
    }</PRE>

<P>The <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> comments direct Perl::Critic to ignore the
remaining lines of code until the end of the current block, or until a
<CODE>&quot;## use critic&quot;</CODE> comment is found (whichever comes first).  If the
<CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> comment is on the same line as a code statement,
then only that line of code is overlooked.  To direct perlcritic to
ignore the <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> comments, use the <CODE>-force</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>A bare <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> comment disables all the active Policies.  If
you wish to disable only specific Policies, add a list of Policy names
as arguments, just as you would for the <CODE>&quot;no strict&quot;</CODE> or <CODE>&quot;no
warnings&quot;</CODE> pragmas.  For example, this would disable the
<CODE>ProhibitEmptyQuotes</CODE> and <CODE>ProhibitPostfixControls</CODE> policies until
the end of the block or until the next <CODE>&quot;## use critic&quot;</CODE> comment
(whichever comes first):

</P>
<PRE>  ## no critic (EmptyQuotes, PostfixControls)

  $foo = &quot;&quot;;                  #Now exempt from ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyQuotes
  $barf = bar() if $foo;      #Now exempt ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls
  $long_int = 10000000000;    #Still subjected to ValuesAndExpression::RequireNumberSeparators</PRE>

<P>Since the Policy names are matched against the arguments as regular
expressions, you can abbreviate the Policy names or disable an entire
family of Policies in one shot like this:

</P>
<PRE>  ## no critic (NamingConventions)

  my $camelHumpVar = 'foo';  #Now exempt from NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseVars
  sub camelHumpSub {}        #Now exempt from NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseSubs</PRE>

<P>The argument list must be enclosed in parens and must contain one or
more comma-separated barewords (e.g. don't use quotes).  The <CODE>&quot;## no
critic&quot;</CODE> pragmas can be nested, and Policies named by an inner pragma
will be disabled along with those already disabled an outer pragma.

</P>
<P>Use this feature wisely.  <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> should be used in the
smallest possible scope, or only on individual lines of code. And you
should always be as specific as possible about which policies you want
to disable (i.e. never use a bare <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE>).  If Perl::Critic
complains about your code, try and find a compliant solution before
resorting to this feature.

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="IMPORTANT%20CHANGES">IMPORTANT CHANGES

</A></H1>

<P>Perl-Critic is evolving rapidly, so some of the interfaces have
changed in ways that are not backward-compatible.  If you have been
using an older version of Perl-Critic and/or you have been developing
custom Policy modules, please read this section carefully.

</P><H2><A NAME="VERSION%200.16">VERSION 0.16

</A></H2>

<P>Starting in version 0.16, you can add a list Policy names as arguments
to the <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> pseudo-pragma.  This feature allows you to
disable specific policies.  So if you have been in the habit of adding
additional words after <CODE>&quot;no critic&quot;</CODE>, then those words might cause
unexpected results.  If you want to append other stuff to the <CODE>&quot;## no
critic&quot;</CODE> comment, then terminate the pseudo-pragma with a semi-colon,
and then start another comment.  For example:

</P>
<PRE>  #This may not work as expected.
  $email = 'foo@bar.com';  ## no critic for literal '@'

  #This will work.
  $email = 'foo@bar.com';  ## no critic; #for literal '@'

  #This is even better.
  $email = 'foo@bar.com'; ## no critic (RequireInterpolation);</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="VERSION%200.14">VERSION 0.14

</A></H2>

<P>Starting in version 0.14, the interface to <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Violation.html">Perl::Critic::Violation</A>
changed.  This will also break any custom Policy modules that you
might have written for earlier modules.  See
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/DEVELOPER.html">Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER</A> for an up-to-date guide on creating Policy
modules.

</P>
<P>The notion of &quot;priority&quot; was also replaced with &quot;severity&quot; in version
0.14.  Consequently, the default behavior of Perl::Critic is to only
load the most &quot;severe&quot; Policy modules, rather than loading all of
them.  This decision was based on user-feedback suggesting that
Perl-Critic should be less critical for new users, and should steer
them toward gradually increasing the strictness as they progressively
adopt better coding practices.


</P><H2><A NAME="VERSION%200.11">VERSION 0.11

</A></H2>

<P>Starting in version 0.11, the internal mechanics of Perl-Critic were
rewritten so that only one traversal of the PPI document tree is
required.  Unfortunately, this will break any custom Policy modules
that you might have written for earlier versions.  Converting your
policies to work with the new version is pretty easy and actually
results in cleaner code.  See <A HREF="Perl/Critic/DEVELOPER.html">Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER</A> for an
up-to-date guide on creating Policy modules.

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="THE%20Perl%3a%3aCritic%20PHILOSOPHY">THE <A HREF="Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A> PHILOSOPHY

</A></H1>

<PRE>  Coding standards are deeply personal and highly subjective.  The
  goal of Perl::Critic is to help you write code that conforms with a
  set of best practices.  Our primary goal is not to dictate what
  those practices are, but rather, to implement the practices
  discovered by others.  Ultimately, you make the rules --
  Perl::Critic is merely a tool for encouraging consistency.  If there
  is a policy that you think is important or that we have overlooked,
  we would be very grateful for contributions, or you can simply load
  your own private set of policies into Perl::Critic.</PRE>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="EXTENDING%20THE%20CRITIC">EXTENDING THE CRITIC

</A></H1>

<P>The modular design of Perl::Critic is intended to facilitate the
addition of new Policies.  You'll need to have some understanding of
<A HREF="PPI.html">PPI</A>, but most Policy modules are pretty straightforward and only
require about 20 lines of code.  Please see the
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/DEVELOPER.html">Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER</A> file included in this distribution for a
step-by-step demonstration of how to create new Policy modules.

</P>
<P>If you develop any new Policy modules, feel free to send them to
<CODE>thaljef@cpan.org</CODE> and I'll be happy to put them into the Perl::Critic
distribution.  Or if you'd like to work on the Perl::Critic project
