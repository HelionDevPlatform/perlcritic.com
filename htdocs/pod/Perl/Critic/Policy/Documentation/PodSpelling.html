<P>Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::PodSpelling - Check your spelling.


</P><H1><A NAME="AFFILIATION">AFFILIATION

</A></H1>

<P>This Policy is part of the core <A HREF="/pod/Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A>
distribution.


</P><H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>Did you write the documentation?  Check.

</P>
<P>Did you document all of the public methods?  Check.

</P>
<P>Is your documentation readable?  Hmm...

</P>
<P>Ideally, we'd like Perl::Critic to tell you when your documentation is
inadequate.  That's hard to code, though.  So, inspired by
<A HREF="Test/Spelling.html">Test::Spelling</A>, this module checks the spelling of
your POD.  It does this by pulling the prose out of the code and
passing it to an external spell checker.  It skips over words you
flagged to ignore.  If the spell checker returns any misspelled words,
this policy emits a violation.

</P>
<P>If anything else goes wrong -- we can't locate the spell checking program or
(gasp!) your module has no POD -- then this policy passes.

</P>
<P>To add exceptions on a module-by-module basis, add &quot;stopwords&quot; as
described in <A HREF="Pod/Spell.html">Pod::Spell</A>.  For example:

</P>
<PRE>    =for stopword gibbles

    =head1 Gibble::Manip -- manipulate your gibbles

    =cut
</PRE>
<H1><A NAME="CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION

</A></H1>

<P>This policy can be configured to tell which spell checker to use or to
set a global list of spelling exceptions.  To do this, put entries in
a <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file like this:

</P>
<PRE>    [Documentation::PodSpelling]
    spell_command = aspell list
    stop_words = gibbles foobar
    stop_words_file = some/path/with/stop/words.txt</PRE>

<P>The default spell command is <CODE>aspell list</CODE> and it is interpreted as a
shell command.  We parse the individual arguments via
<A HREF="Text/ParseWords.html">Text::ParseWords</A> so feel free to use quotes around
your arguments.  If the executable path is an absolute file name, it
is used as-is.  If it is a relative file name, we employ
<A HREF="File/Which.html">File::Which</A> to convert it to an absolute path via the
<CODE>PATH</CODE> environment variable.  As described in Pod::Spell and
Test::Spelling, the spell checker must accept text on STDIN and print
misspelled words one per line on STDOUT.

</P>
<P>You can specify global stop words via the <CODE>stop_words</CODE> and
<CODE>stop_words_file</CODE> options.  The former is simply split up on
whitespace.  The latter is looked at line by line, with anything after
an octothorp (&quot;#&quot;) removed and then leading and trailing whitespace
removed.  Silly example valid file contents:

</P>
<PRE>    # It's a comment!

    foo
    arglbargl    # Some other comment.
    bar</PRE>

<P>The values from <CODE>stop_words</CODE> and <CODE>stop_words_file</CODE> are merged
together into a single list of exemptions.


</P><H1><A NAME="NOTES">NOTES

</A></H1>

<P>A spell checking program is not included with Perl::Critic.

</P>
<P>The results of failures for this policy can be confusing when <I>aspell</I>
complains about words containing punctuation such as hyphens and apostrophes.
In this situation <I>aspell</I> will often only emit part of the word that it
thinks is misspelled.  For example, if you ask <I>aspell</I> to check
&quot;foobie-bletch&quot;, the output only complains about &quot;foobie&quot;.  Unfortunately,
you'll have to look through your POD to figure out what the real word that
<I>aspell</I> is complaining about is.  One thing to try is looking at the output
of <CODE>perl -MPod::Spell -e 'print
Pod::Spell-&gt;new()-&gt;parse_from_file(&quot;lib/Your/Module.pm&quot;)'</CODE> to see what is
actually being checked for spelling.

<P>This policy will disable itself if <A HREF="File/Which.html">File::Which</A> is not
available.
