<P>Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::RequireLocalizedPunctuationVars - Magic variables should be assigned as &quot;local&quot;.


</P><HR>

<P>This Policy is part of the core <A HREF="../../../../Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A>
distribution.

<P>Punctuation variables (and their English.pm equivalents) are global
variables.  Messing with globals is dangerous in a complex program as
it can lead to very subtle and hard to fix bugs.  If you must change a
magic variable in a non-trivial program, do it in a local scope.

</P>
<P>For example, to slurp a filehandle into a scalar, it's common to set
the record separator to undef instead of a newline.  If you choose to
do this (instead of using <A HREF="../../../../File/Slurp.html">File::Slurp</A>!) then be sure to
localize the global and change it for as short a time as possible.

</P>
<PRE>    # BAD:
    $/ = undef;
    my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;

    # BETTER:
    my $content;
    {
        local $/ = undef;
        $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    }

    # A popular idiom:
    my $content = do { local $/ = undef; &lt;$fh&gt; };</PRE>

<P>This policy also allows the use of <CODE>my</CODE>.  Perl prevents using <CODE>my</CODE>
with &quot;proper&quot; punctuation variables, but allows <CODE>$a</CODE>, <CODE>@ARGV</CODE>, the
names declared by <A HREF="../../../../English.html">English</A>, etc.  This is not a good coding
practice, however it is not the concern of this specific policy to
complain about that.

<P>The current PPI (v1.118) has a bug where $^ variables absorb following
whitespace by mistake.  This makes it harder to spot those as magic
variables.  Hopefully this will be fixed by PPI 1.200.  In the
meantime, we have a workaround in this module.

</P>
<P>Additionally, PPI v1.118 fails to recognize %! and %^H as magic
variables.  PPI instead sees the &quot;%&quot; as a modulus operator.  We have
no workaround for that bug right now.
