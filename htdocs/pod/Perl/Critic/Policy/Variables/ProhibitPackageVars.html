<P>Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::ProhibitPackageVars

</P><H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

<P>Conway suggests avoiding package variables completely, because they
expose your internals to other packages.  Never use a package variable
when a lexical variable will suffice.  If your package needs to keep
some dynamic state, consider using an object or closures to keep the
state private.

</P>
<P>This policy assumes that you're using <CODE>strict vars</CODE> so that naked
variable declarations are not package variables by default.  Thus, it
complains you declare a variable with <CODE>our</CODE> or <CODE>use vars</CODE>, or if you
make reference to variable with a fully-qualified package name.

</P>
<PRE>  $Some::Package::foo = 1;    #not ok
  our $foo            = 1;    #not ok
  use vars '$foo';            #not ok
  $foo = 1;                   #not allowed by 'strict'
  local $foo = 1;             #bad taste, but technically ok.
  use vars '$FOO';            #ok, because it's ALL CAPS
  my $foo = 1;                #ok</PRE>

<P>In practice though, its not really practical to prohibit all package
variables.  Common variables like <CODE>$VERSION</CODE> and <CODE>@EXPORT</CODE> need to
be global, as do any variables that you want to Export.  To work
around this, the Policy overlooks any variables that are in ALL_CAPS.
This forces you to put all your exported variables in ALL_CAPS too, which
seems to be the usual practice anyway.
