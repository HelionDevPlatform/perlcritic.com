<P>Perl::Critic::Policy::Miscellanea::ProhibitUselessNoCritic - Remove ineffective &quot;## no critic&quot; annotations.


</P><H1><A NAME="AFFILIATION">AFFILIATION

</A></H1>

<P>This Policy is part of the core <A HREF="../../../../Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A> distribution.


</P><H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>Sometimes, you may need to use a <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> annotation to work around
a false-positive bug in <A HREF="../../../../Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A>.  But eventually, that bug might get
fixed, leaving your code with extra <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> annotations lying about.
Or you may use them to locally disable a Policy, but then later decide to
permanently remove that Policy entirely from your profile, making some of
those <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> annotations pointless.  Or, you may accidentally
disable too many Policies at once, creating an opportunity for new
violations to slip in unnoticed.

</P>
<P>This Policy will emit violations if you have a <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> annotation in
your source code that does not actually suppress any violations given your
current profile.  To resolve this, you should either remove the annotation
entirely, or adjust the Policy name patterns in the annotation to match only
the Policies that are actually being violated in your code.


</P><H1><A NAME="EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE

</A></H1>

<P>For example, let's say I have a regex, but I don't want to use the <CODE>/x</CODE> flag,
which violates the <CODE>RegularExpressions::RequireExtendedFormatting</CODE> policy.
In the following code, the <CODE>&quot;## no critic&quot;</CODE> annotation will suppress
violations of that Policy and ALL Policies that match
<CODE>m/RegularExpressions/imx</CODE>

</P>
<PRE>  my $re = qr/foo bar baz/ms;  ## no critic (RegularExpressions)</PRE>

<P>However, this creates a potential loop-hole for someone to introduce
additional violations in the future, without explicitly acknowledging them.
This Policy is designed to catch these situations by warning you that you've
disabled more Policies than the situation really requires.  The above code
should be remedied like this:

</P>
<PRE>  my $re = qr/foo bar baz/ms;  ## no critic (RequireExtendedFormatting)</PRE>

<P>Notice how the <CODE>RequireExtendedFormatting</CODE> pattern more precisely matches
the name of the Policy that I'm trying to suppress.


</P><H1><A NAME="NOTE">NOTE

</A></H1>

<P>Changing your <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file and disabling policies globally or running
at a higher (i.e. less restrictive) severity level may cause this Policy to
emit additional violations.  So you might want to defer using this Policy
until you have a fairly stable profile.

<P>This Policy is not configurable except for the standard options.
