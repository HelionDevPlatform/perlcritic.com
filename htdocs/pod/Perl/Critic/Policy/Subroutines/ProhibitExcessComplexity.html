<P>Perl::Critic::Policy::Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>All else being equal, complicated code is more error-prone and more
expensive to maintain than simpler code.  The first step towards
managing complexity is to establish formal complexity metrics.  One
such metric is the McCabe score, which describes the number of
possible paths through a subroutine.  This Policy approximates the
McCabe score by summing the number of conditional statements and
operators within a subroutine.  Research has shown that a McCabe score
higher than 20 is a sign of high-risk, potentially untestable code.
See <A HREF="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/str/descriptions/cyclomatic_body.html">http://www.sei.cmu.edu/str/descriptions/cyclomatic_body.html</A>
for some discussion about the McCabe number and other complexity
metrics.

</P>
<P>The usual prescription for reducing complexity is to refactor code
into smaller subroutines.  Mark Dominus book &quot;Higher Order Perl&quot; also
describes callbacks, recursion, memoization, iterators, and other
techniques that help create simple and extensible Perl code.

<P>The maximum acceptable McCabe can be set with the <CODE>max_mccabe</CODE>
configuration item.  Any subroutine with a McCabe score higher than
this number will generate a policy violation.  The default is 20.  An
example section for a <I>.perlcriticrc</I>:

<PRE>  &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.&quot;

</PRE>

<P>Complexity is subjective, but formal complexity metrics are still
incredibly valuable.  Every problem has an inherent level of
complexity, so it is not necessarily optimal to minimize the McCabe
number.  So don't get offended if your code triggers this Policy.
Just consider if there <B>might</B> be a simpler way to get the job done.
