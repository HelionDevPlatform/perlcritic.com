<P>Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::RequireTrailingCommas

</P><H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>Conway suggests that all elements in a multi-line list should be
separated by commas, including the last element.  This makes it a
little easier to re-order the list by cutting and pasting.

</P>
<PRE>  my @list = ($foo,
              $bar,
              $baz);  #not ok

  my @list = ($foo,
              $bar,
              $baz,); #ok</PRE>

<P>In the PPI parlance, a &quot;list&quot; is almost anything with parens.  I've
tried to make this Policy smart by targeting only &quot;lists&quot; that have at
least one element and are being assigned to something.  However, there
may be some edge cases that I haven't covered.  If you find one, send
me a note.
