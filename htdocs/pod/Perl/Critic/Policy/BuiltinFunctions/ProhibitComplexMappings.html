<P>Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitComplexMappings - Map blocks should have a single statement.


</P><H1><A NAME="AFFILIATION">AFFILIATION

</A></H1>

<P>This Policy is part of the core <A HREF="../../../../Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A>
distribution.


</P><H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>The map function can be confusing to novices in the best of
circumstances.  Mappings with multiple statements are even worse.
They're also a maintainer's nightmare because any added complexity
decreases readability precipitously.  Why?  Because map is
traditionally a one-liner converting one array to another.  Trying to
cram lots of functionality into a one-liner is a bad idea in general.

</P>
<P>The best solutions to a complex mapping are: 1) write a subroutine
that performs the manipulation and call that from map; 2) rewrite the
map as a for loop.

<P>This policy currently misses some compound statements inside of the
map.  For example, the following code incorrectly does not trigger a
violation:

</P>
<PRE>    map { do { foo(); bar() } } @list
</PRE>

</A></H1>

<P>By default this policy flags any mappings with more than one
statement.  While we do not recommend it, you can increase this limit
as follows in a <I>.perlcriticrc</I> file:

</P>
<PRE>    [BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitComplexMappings]
    max_statements = 2
</PRE>
