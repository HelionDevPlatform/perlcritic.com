<P>Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER - How to make new Perl::Critic::Policy modules

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>For developers who want to create custom coding standards, the
following tells how to create a Policy module for <A HREF="Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A>.
Although the Perl::Critic distribution already includes a number of
Policies based on Damian Conway's book <I>Perl Best Practices</I> (which
will be referred to via &quot;<I>PBP</I>&quot; from here on), Perl::Critic is not
limited to his guidelines and can be used to enforce any practice,
preference, or style that you want to follow.  You can even write
Policies to enforce contradictory guidelines.  All you need to do is
write a corresponding <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Policy.html">Perl::Critic::Policy</A> subclass, which may
require as little as 10 lines of code.

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND

</A></H1>

<P>The heart of Perl::Critic is <A HREF="PPI.html">PPI</A>, a parser and lexer for Perl.  PPI
transforms Perl source code into a Document Object Model (DOM).  Each
token in the document is represented by a PPI class, such as
<A HREF="PPI/Token/Operator.html">PPI::Token::Operator</A> or <A HREF="PPI/Token/Word.html">PPI::Token::Word</A>, and then organized
into structure classes, like <A HREF="PPI/Statement/Expression.html">PPI::Statement::Expression</A> and
<A HREF="PPI/Structure/Subroutine.html">PPI::Structure::Subroutine</A>. The root node of the hierarchy is the
<A HREF="PPI/Document.html">PPI::Document</A>.

</P>
<P>The <A HREF="Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A> engine traverses each node in the <A HREF="PPI/Document.html">PPI::Document</A>
tree and invokes each of the <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Policy.html">Perl::Critic::Policy</A> subclasses at the
appropriate node.  The Policy can inspect the node, look at the
surrounding nodes, and do whatever else it wants.  If the Policy
decides that that a coding standard has been violated, it returns one
or more <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Violation.html">Perl::Critic::Violation</A> objects.  If there are no
violations, then the Policy returns nothing.

</P>
<P>Policies are usually written based on existing policies, so let's look
at one to see how it works.  The <I>RequireBlockGrep.pm</I> Policy is
relatively simple and demonstrates most of the important issues.  The
goal of this Policy is to enforce that every call to <CODE>grep</CODE> uses a
block for the first argument and not an expression.  The reasons for
this Policy are discussed in detail in <I>PBP</I>.

</P><HR>
<H1><A NAME="EXAMPLE%20POLICY">EXAMPLE POLICY

</A></H1>

<P>First, the Policy module needs to have a name.  Perl::Critic uses
<A HREF="Module/Pluggable.html">Module::Pluggable</A> to automatically discover all modules in the
<CODE>Perl::Critic::Policy</CODE> namespace.  Also, we've adopted the convention
of grouping Policies into directories according to the chapters of
<I>PBP</I>.  Since the goal of this Policy is to enforce the use of block
arguments to <CODE>grep</CODE> and it comes from the &quot;Builtin Functions&quot; chapter
of <I>PBP</I>, we call it
<CODE>&quot;Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::RequireBlockGrep&quot;</CODE>.

</P>
<PRE>  package Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::RequireBlockGrep;</PRE>

<P>Next, we set some pragmas and load the modules that we'll need.  All
Policy modules inherit from the <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Policy.html">Perl::Critic::Policy</A> class, which
provides no-op implementations of the basic methods.  Our job is to
override these methods to make them do something useful.

</P>
<P>Technically, <CODE>use strict</CODE> and <CODE>use warnings</CODE> are optional, but we
don't want Perl::Critic to be a hypocrite, now do we?

</P>
<PRE>  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use Readonly;

  use Perl::Critic::Utils qw{ :severities :classification :ppi };
  use base 'Perl::Critic::Policy';

  our $VERSION = '1.05';</PRE>

<P>Next, we'll declare a description and explanation for this Policy.
The description is always just a string that basically says &quot;this is
what's wrong.&quot;  The explanation can be either a string with further
details, or a reference to an array of integers that correspond to
page numbers in <I>PBP</I>.  We make them read-only because they never
change.  (See
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/ValuesAndExpressions.html#ProhibitConstantPragma">Perl::Critic::ValuesAndExpressions/ProhibitConstantPragma</A> for why
we don't <CODE>use constant</CODE>.)

</P>
<PRE>  Readonly::Scalar my $DESC =&gt; q{Expression form of &quot;grep&quot;};
  Readonly::Scalar my $EXPL =&gt; [ 169 ];</PRE>

<P>Most policies don't need to override the <CODE>new()</CODE> method provided by
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/Policy.html">Perl::Critic::Policy</A>.  However, if your Policy is configurable via
<I>.perlcriticrc</I> you should implement a <CODE>supported_parameters()</CODE>
method and need to override the constructor to examine the <CODE>%config</CODE>
values.  (To future-proof your policy, make sure that your constructor
invokes the super-constructor.)  Since this Policy isn't configurable,
we'll declare that by providing an implementation of
<CODE>supported_parameters()</CODE> that returns an empty list.

</P>
<PRE>  sub supported_parameters { return ()                  }</PRE>

<P>Next, we define the <CODE>default_severity()</CODE> method, which must return an
integer indicating the severity of violating this Policy.  Severity
values range from 1 to 5, where 5 is the &quot;most severe.&quot;  In general,
level 5 is reserved for things that are frequently misused and/or
cause bugs.  Level 1 is for things that are highly subjective or
purely cosmetic.  The <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Utils.html">Perl::Critic::Utils</A> package exports several
severity constants that you can use here via the <CODE>:severities</CODE> tag.

</P>
<PRE>  sub default_severity     { return $SEVERITY_HIGH      }</PRE>

<P>Likewise, the <CODE>default_themes()</CODE> method returns a list of theme
names.  Themes are intended to be named groups of Policies.  All
Policies that ship with Perl::Critic have a <CODE>&quot;core&quot;</CODE> theme.  Since
use of <CODE>grep</CODE> without blocks often leads to bugs, we include a
<CODE>&quot;bugs&quot;</CODE> theme.  And since this Policy comes directly from <I>PBP</I>,
this Policy should be a member of the <CODE>&quot;pbp&quot;</CODE> theme.

</P>
<PRE>  sub default_themes       { return qw( core bugs pbp ) }</PRE>

<P>As a Policy author, you can assign any themes you want to the Policy.
If you're publishing a suite of custom Policies, we suggest that you
create a unique theme that covers all the Policies in the
distribution.  That way, users can easily enable or disable all of
your policies at once.  For example, Policies in the
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/More.html">Perl::Critic::More</A> distribution all have a <CODE>&quot;more&quot;</CODE> theme.

</P>
<P>Next, we indicate what elements of the code this Policy will analyze,
like statements or variables or conditionals or POD.  These elements
are specified as PPI classes such as <A HREF="PPI/Statement.html">PPI::Statement</A>,
<A HREF="PPI/Token/Symbol.html">PPI::Token::Symbol</A>, <A HREF="PPI/Structure/Conditional.html">PPI::Structure::Conditional</A> or
<A HREF="PPI/Token/Pod.html">PPI::Token::Pod</A> respectively.  The applies_to() method returns a
list of PPI package names.  (You can get that list of available
package names via <CODE>perldoc PPI</CODE>.)  As Perl::Critic traverses the
document, it will call the <CODE>violates()</CODE> method from this module
whenever it encounters one of the PPI types that are given here.  In
this case, we just want to test calls to <CODE>grep</CODE>.  Since the token
&quot;grep&quot; is a <A HREF="PPI/Token/Word.html">PPI::Token::Word</A>, we return that package name from the
<CODE>applies_to()</CODE> method.

</P>
<PRE>  sub applies_to           { return 'PPI::Token::Word'  }</PRE>

<P>If your Policy needs to analyze several different types of elements,
the <CODE>applies_to</CODE> method may return the name of several PPI packages.
If your Policy needs to examine the file as a whole, then the
<CODE>applies_to</CODE> method should return <A HREF="PPI/Document.html">PPI::Document</A>.  Since there is
only one PPI::Document element, your Policy would only be invoked once
per file.

</P>
<P>Now comes the interesting part.  The <CODE>violates()</CODE> method does all the
work.  It is always called with 2 arguments: a reference to the
current PPI element that Perl::Critic is traversing, and a reference
to the entire PPI document. [And since this is an object method, there
will be an additional argument that is a reference to this object
(<CODE>$self</CODE>), but you already knew that!]  Since this Policy does not
need access to the document as a whole, we ignore the last parameter
by assigning to <CODE>undef</CODE>.

</P>
<PRE>  sub violates {
      my ( $self, $elem, undef ) = @_;</PRE>

<P>The violates() method then often performs some tests to make sure we
have the right &quot;type&quot; of element.  In our example, we know that the
element will be a <A HREF="PPI/Token/Word.html">PPI::Token::Word</A> because that's what we declared
back in the <CODE>applies_to()</CODE> method.  However, we didn't specify
exactly which &quot;word&quot; we were looking for.  Evaluating a PPI element in
a string context returns the literal form of the code.  So we make
sure that this PPI::Token::Word is, in fact, &quot;grep&quot;.  If it's not,
then we don't' need to bother examining it.

</P>
<PRE>      return if $elem ne 'grep';</PRE>

<P>The <CODE>PPI::Token::Word</CODE> class is also used for barewords and methods
called on object references.  It is possible for someone to declare a
bareword hash key as <CODE>&lt;%hash = ( grep =</CODE> 'foo' )&gt;&gt;.  We don't want to
test those types of elements because they don't represent function
calls to <CODE>grep</CODE>.  So we use one of handy utility functions from
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/Utils.html">Perl::Critic::Utils</A> to make sure that this &quot;grep&quot; is actually in
the right context.  (The <CODE>is_function_call()</CODE> subroutine is brought
in via the <CODE>:classification</CODE> tag.)

</P>
<PRE>      return if ! is_function_call($elem);</PRE>

<P>Now that we know this element is a call to the <CODE>grep</CODE> function, we
can look at the nearby elements to see what kind of arguments are
being passed to it.  In the following paragraphs, we discuss how to do
this manually in order to explore <A HREF="PPI.html">PPI</A>; after that, we'll show how
this Policy actually uses facilities provided by
<A HREF="Perl/Critic/Utils.html">Perl::Critic::Utils</A> to get this done.

</P>
<P>Every PPI element is linked to its siblings, parent, and children (if
it has any).  Since those siblings could just be whitespace, we use
the <CODE>snext_sibling()</CODE> to get the next code-sibling (the 's' in
<CODE>snext_sibling</CODE> stands for 'significant').

</P>
<PRE>      my $sib = $elem-&gt;snext_sibling() || return;</PRE>

<P>In Perl, the parenthesis around argument lists are usually optional,
and PPI packs the elements into a <A HREF="PPI/Structure/List.html">PPI::Structure::List</A> object when
parens are used.  So if the sibling is a PPI::Structure::List, we pull
out the first (significant) child of that list.  This child will be
the first argument to <CODE>grep</CODE>.  If parens were not used, then the
sibling itself is the first argument.

</P>
<PRE>      my $arg = $sib-&gt;isa('PPI::Structure::List') ? $sib-&gt;schild(0) : $sib;</PRE>

<P>In actuality, this sort of function argument lookup is common, so
there is a <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Utils.html#first_arg">Perl::Critic::Utils/&quot;first_arg&quot;</A> subroutine available via
the <CODE>:ppi</CODE> tag.  So we use that instead.

</P>
<PRE>      my $arg = first_arg($elem);</PRE>

<P>Finally, we now have a reference to the first argument to <CODE>grep</CODE>.  If
that argument is a block (i.e. something in curly braces), then it
will be a <A HREF="PPI/Structure/Block.html">PPI::Structure::Block</A>, in which case our Policy is
satisfied and we just return nothing.

</P>
<PRE>      return if !$arg;
      return if $arg-&gt;isa('PPI::Structure::Block');</PRE>

<P>But if it is not a <A HREF="PPI/Structure/Block.html">PPI::Structure::Block</A>, then we know that this
call to <CODE>grep</CODE> must be using the expression form, and that violates
our Policy.  So we create and return a new <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Violation.html">Perl::Critic::Violation</A>
object via the <A HREF="Perl/Critic/Policy.html#violation">Perl::Critic::Policy/&quot;violation&quot;</A> method, passing in
the description, explanation, and a reference to the PPI element that
caused the violation.  And that's all there is to it!

</P>
<PRE>      return $self-&gt;violation( $DESC, $EXPL, $elem );
  }

  1;</PRE>

<P>One last thing -- people are going to need to understand what is wrong
with the code when your Policy finds a problem.  It isn't reasonable
to include all the details in your violation description or
explanation.  So please include a DESCRIPTION section in the POD for
your Policy.  It should succinctly describe the behavior and
motivation for your Policy and include a few examples of both good and
bad code.  Here's an example:

</P>
<PRE>  =pod

  =head1 NAME

  Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::RequireBlockGrep

  =head1 DESCRIPTION

  The expression forms of C&lt;grep&gt; and C&lt;map&gt; are awkward and hard to read.
  Use the block forms instead.

    @matches = grep  /pattern/,    @list;        #not ok
    @matches = grep { /pattern/ }  @list;        #ok

    @mapped = map  transform($_),    @list;      #not ok
    @mapped = map { transform($_) }  @list;      #ok

  =cut</PRE>

<P>When your policy has a section like this, users can invoke
<A HREF="perlcritic.html">perlcritic</A> with a <CODE>--verbose</CODE> parameter of <CODE>10</CODE> or <CODE>11</CODE> to see
it along with the rest of the output for violations of your policy.
